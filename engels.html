      <h2 class="secondTitle">History</h2>
      <p>
        Van Gogh was born in Zundert in Brabant,
        a village near the Belgian border,
        as son of the preacher Theodorus van Gogh (1822-1885) and Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819-1907)
        As a child Vincent was a taciturn,
        somewhat introverted boy.
        From January to October 1861 he attended the village school,
        but the following year he was dropped from school and home-schooled.
        According to his parents, the contact with the village children at the village school would make him too rough.
        On October 1, 1864 Vincent went to the boarding school of master Jan Provily in Zevenbergen,
        where he stayed for two years, until August 1866.
        On September 15, 1866, he was enrolled at the Rijks HBS Koning Willem II in Tilburg, located in the former palace of King Willem II and the current Palace-Raadhuis of Tilburg,
        where he received drawing lessons from the painter Constant Cornelis Huijsmans (1810-1886).
        Huijsmans was known as an excellent art teacher,

      <h2 class="secondTitle">History of the building</h2>
      <p>
        The Van Gogh Museum is a Dutch art museum dedicated to the works of Vincent van Gogh.
        The museum was opened on June 2, 1973 and the buildings were designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Kisho Kurokawa.
        The museum contains the largest collection of paintings and drawings by Van Gogh in the world.
        In 2017, the museum had 2.3 million visitors and was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 23rd most visited art museum in the world.
        In 2019, the Van Gogh Museum launched the Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience, a technology-driven 'immersive exhibition' about the life and work of Van Gogh,
        who toured worldwide.
        
        The architecture of the Van Gogh Museum has a varied history.
        The main building was designed by Gerrit Rietveld and opened in 1973.
        The exhibition wing, designed by the architect Kisho Kurokawa, was completed in 1999.
        In addition to these two architects, various other designers have contributed to the rebuilding or renovation of the
        House.
        In the spring of 2014, a start was made on the construction of a new entrance on Museumplein.
